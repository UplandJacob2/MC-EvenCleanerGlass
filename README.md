# MC-EvenCleanerGlass

**This is a simple resource pack to add a cleaner glass texture to Minecraft.**

This was specifically created/tested for [Eaglercraft](https://eaglercraft.com). Eaglercraft is a Minecraft 1.8.8 client so it uses old textures. I use JAPPA-Backport for MC-1.8 to add newer textures, but I wanted an even cleaner glass texture, so here we are.
